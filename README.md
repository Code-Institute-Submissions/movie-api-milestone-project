# movie-api-milstone-project

The aim of this web application is too allow users to search for  
Movie's they have heard about or a movie that they would like to view  
And get information on that movie such as metascore, release date and   
plot of the film. They can also use the goggle maps section at the   
bottom to find cinemas near them. 

## UX

A person using this app would want to find out information about    
a film they have heard about or been recommended to, to see if it     
is something they would want to consume themselves. To do this    
I placed a search bar in a prominent position with instructions    
oh how to search for a film title, once the search button is     
clicked, a list of matching films with basic information is    
displayed in an easy to read format, this way the user can     
choose the correct film they are looking for. When the user has    
found the correct film they can then click on the film to retrieve    
more information on the movie such as the plot and actors in the film.   

The Person using the app may also wish to go view on of the films they    
are searching for at a cinema, to assist with this I added functionality   
That allows the user to search for nearby cinemas using goggle maps.  
I followed the same search bar layout as above for the search functionality  
As consistency in design is more pleasing to look at and creates better   
user experience. They can search by using the name of the place they want  
To search around, once the search button is clicked the map will show the  
Location of cinemas nearby.  

In regards to the design of the application I looked at different colour  
Schemes and decided on a gold/ black theme, this was because I think it  
Gives a more premium look to the app, I also decided not to include too  
Much text as I didn't want the page to look to cluttered and cause the user  
To read through too much text to find out how to use the app. To help with  
This I created a basic wireframe[WIREFRAME](https://github.com/cball1990/movie-api-milestone-project/blob/master/wireframe.jpg)
to make sure my choices where visually   
appealing. As you can see from the wireframe, the maps section was not  
Included as this was a feature I decided to add later in the development.  
I made other changes such as when the logo is clicked it clears the app back  
To its original state when the app is first opened, and I moved the location  
Of the search bar because it was hard to see and it had to be very short to  
Fit in the top bar of the page, this caused the problem of not being able  
To read what was entered.
